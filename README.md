# Comic Calalogue

## Description
Shows a grid of comic images retrieved from the Marvel API. Clicking on a comic shows more detailed information about the comic.

The comics grid is searchable, and shows a subset of comics that are available. Clicking the "Show More" button retrieves a new set of comics.

## Implementation

By sourcing and using appropriate Angular modules, a solution can be built quickly with less code that is in line with AngularJS idioms.

The application is built with AngularJS and Bootstrap and also includes the following:

- Angular-filter - Pre-built custom filters. Used to easily split the comics into sub-arrays (https://github.com/a8m/angular-filter)
- AngularUI Bootstrap - Provides Angular directives for Bootstrap components, like the alert message for errors (https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
- jQuery - required for Bootstrap's Javascript, but not used for DOM manipulation


## Installation

From the project directory, run:

`bower install`
